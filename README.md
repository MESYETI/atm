# Atoment (2)!
my new programming language, it isn't usable yet as right now it is only a lexer
# Compiling
use `make` to create a normal build and `make release` to make a release build
# Running
./bin/atm path/to/myprogram.atm

# Example
```js
println: "hello";
println: "NULL points to ", NULL;
println: "MEM_START points to ", MEM_START;
println: "true = ", true;
println: "false = ", false;
```
